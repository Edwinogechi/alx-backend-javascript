Project Name: 0x06-unittests_in_js

Description:
This project aims to explore and demonstrate the implementation of unit tests in JavaScript. Unit testing is an essential practice in software development, where individual components or units of code are tested in isolation to ensure they perform as expected. By using unit tests, developers can verify the correctness of their code and catch bugs early in the development process.

Features:

Provides examples of unit tests written in JavaScript.
Demonstrates how to set up testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha.
Covers various testing techniques including assertion libraries, mocking, and test runners.
Includes examples of testing asynchronous code using techniques like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
